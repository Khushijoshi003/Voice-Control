🎬 How to Use
Open any YouTube video.
Click the extension icon.
Hit “Start Listening.”
Speak your command (e.g., “pause”, “play”, “mute”, “fullscreen”, “screenshot”, etc.).
Watch the magic happen!

🧑‍💻 How it Works
Uses the browser’s built-in speech recognition.
Sends your command to the video player on the page.
No data leaves your browser. Privacy-friendly!

📝 Notes
Works best on YouTube.
For screenshot, the image will be saved as a PNG.
If speech recognition fails, just click “Start Listening” again.
Some features (like quality change) aren’t supported due to YouTube limitations.

🤔 Troubleshooting
If the extension isn’t working, refresh the YouTube page and try again.
Make sure your microphone is enabled for Chrome.
Check the console for errors (right-click, Inspect, Console).
